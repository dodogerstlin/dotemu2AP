Tool to convert Dotemu Neo Geo roms to format expected by Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo core

I'm trying to legally source Neo Geo roms to use with the Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo core OpenFPGA core. The file formats seem to be a mess. For now this is a learning project for me. It is heavily inspired by dotemu2mame.js from cxx https://gist.github.com/cxx/81b9f45eb5b3cb87b4f3783ccdf8894f
